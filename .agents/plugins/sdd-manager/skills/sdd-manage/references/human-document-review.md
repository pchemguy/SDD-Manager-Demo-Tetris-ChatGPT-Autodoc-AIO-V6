# Human review of development documents

## Development-document content boundary

**Development documents describe the project, not the SDD process used to prepare them.** Enforce this when creating, revising or reviewing PROJECT, ARCHITECTURE, DECOMPOSITION, SPEC, PLAN, layout and TASKS, including feature counterparts and focused children. It applies in every document-design mode, with or without human checkpoint preapproval.

State the project's intended scope, design, contracts, delivery strategy, physical structure or executable work directly, according to the document's role. Do not insert documentation mode/pass numbers, cursor state, future document-revision sequences, checkpoint approval state or reset mechanics, or make a product requirement contingent on a later documentation pass. For main preparation, keep that control information in DOCS_PREPARATION; DOCS_TASKS holds tasks/checkoffs only and HANDOFF links their owners. Feature/revision evidence stays with its existing workflow owner. Use it to select the applicable scope without narrating it in the development document. Future scope stays in its workflow record until adopted; do not import it early or turn its current absence into a permanent product exclusion.

PLAN and TASKS retain the project's actual implementation phases, milestones, work, dependencies and exits. Review each selected root and child for preparation-process leakage before publication or dependent use, even when its scope statements are otherwise accurate. Report and correct a violation within the owning scope; a read-only review reports it without editing. Mode selection and preapproval do not waive this content check.

## Entry and existing progress

At greenfield entry, walk the human through the necessary document chain. At existing or interrupted project/feature entry, sdd-orient observes actual progress, decisions, document identities and unresolved instructions; the selected owners assess missing technical readiness. Orientation remains read-only and does not silently author or repair documents.

Reuse acceptable existing inputs and proceed to the next eligible stage within the request. Missing retrospective human-acceptance records alone do not require interactive replay. File presence alone does not establish readiness. Preserve an actual pending checkpoint, requested review or explicit stopping instruction; interruption does not erase it.

If the human explicitly requests interactive review of existing artifacts, begin with that review before dependent progression. Present concise substantive analysis and resolve the selected review, rather than listing files or announcing a Ready result. Important issues found at startup warrant a concrete concern, its consequence and affected next stage, and an offer of interactive review before advancing. An offer does not activate interactive mode until selected. Declining it does not clear a consequential readiness blocker; continue independent eligible work when possible.

## Future-checkpoint preapproval

For main preparation, apply the selected [doc-design mode](doc-design-modes.md): interactive/onepass is the ordinary default; autodoc selects scoped later-document preapproval and an earlier stop. Autoloop retains the first PROJECT checkpoint, explicitly waives later PROJECT approvals and delegates new material decisions as defined there. Human-controlled multipass retains each pass's PROJECT checkpoint. Record this mode basis rather than claiming individual human approvals that did not occur.

The user may explicitly preapprove any future human checkpoint at any point, individually or as a scoped set, including document acceptance, initialization continuation and the final preimplementation checkpoint. Retain the actual scope, conditions and later revocation in DOCS_PREPARATION for main preparation, or the existing owning evidence for other workflows, including across interruptions. A covered checkpoint still requires authoring, QC, reporting, persistence and required hosted operations, but no repeated acceptance pause. Preapproval does not clear technical blockers or unresolved consequential decisions, grant missing repository authority or select/expand an implementation range. A generic development request, repository-operation authority, silence or clarification is not preapproval. Persist a changed grant/revocation in its owning evidence before dependent work so [checkpoint recovery](continuity.md#reconstruct-after-the-checkpoint) finds it even when HANDOFF predates that decision; no per-decision handoff refresh is required when the existing records suffice.

## Created-document checkpoints

Unless explicitly covered by applicable preapproval, each newly created necessary root/proposal has its own human review checkpoint, including direct owner calls and combined preparation requests. Relevant focused children are presented with their root.

| New document/proposal | Owner | Hold before |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PROJECT | sdd-design | Dependent ARCHITECTURE or other use of the brief. |
| ARCHITECTURE / FEATURE_ARCHITECTURE | sdd-design | Dependent DECOMPOSITION or contract work. |
| DECOMPOSITION / FEATURE_DECOMPOSITION | sdd-design | Dependent SPEC. |
| SPEC / FEATURE-SPEC | sdd-specify | Dependent PLAN. |
| PLAN / FEATURE-PLAN | sdd-plan | Dependent layout or TASKS. |
| layout / needed feature layout proposal | sdd-plan | Dependent TASKS. |
| TASKS / FEATURE-TASKS | sdd-tasks | Implementation or hosted task projection. |

Preserve dependency order: PROJECT, ARCHITECTURE, DECOMPOSITION, SPEC, PLAN, layout, TASKS. Optional feature overlays remain optional; reuse sufficient main design, strategy and layout. Do not create documents merely to fill this table. A feature brief is established in exploration/package evidence; create PROJECT only when genuinely selected. Use existing layout/feature-plan owners for a scoped placement proposal, without inventing a FEATURE-LAYOUT filename.

1. Complete the selected root/proposal and children, check the [development-document content boundary](#development-document-content-boundary) and perform applicable owner QC. Under existing Git authority, commit, push and verify remote containment before presenting the reviewable result, following [per-commit publication](git-workflows.md#publish-each-commit).
2. Present links and concise analysis of purpose/coverage, consequential choices and rationale, consistency/gaps, assumptions/open questions, QC evidence/limits and a reasoned recommendation. For features, include changed behavior, affected main guarantees, compatibility/integration effects and scope/deferrals. Name the dependent operation being held.
3. Pause for the human decision unless explicit applicable preapproval covers this checkpoint; record that preapproval as the decision basis rather than claiming a later interactive approval. Agent QC, Ready, commits/pushes and broad authorization to develop or prepare through TASKS do not accept an unreviewed new document. Clarification answers supply requirements or decisions within their stated scope; they do not accept an artifact or authorize downstream stages. Silence or comments without acceptance keep the checkpoint pending.
4. Record the actual decision with document/proposal scope and exact presented state (commit/blob or content identity) in DOCS_PREPARATION for main preparation, or the existing owning feature/campaign evidence for other workflows. Keep pending, accepted and revise decisions distinguishable from technical readiness. No new journal, registry or mandatory report per design root is required.
5. While acceptance is pending, answer questions or route requested current-stage revisions to the owner within scope. Recheck affected concerns, present the revised reviewable state and stop at the same checkpoint; do not author dependent artifacts or begin/advance implementation before the required acceptance. Acceptance-and-proceed clears the presented scope and its authorized next step; only an explicit applicable future-checkpoint preapproval covers unseen downstream documents. If the human explicitly changes checkpoint scope, retain that decision; generic authorization is not a waiver.

For main preparation, [main preparation](main-preparation.md#document-tasks-through-first-approval) owns the approval/task commit and subsequent issue closure: DOCS tasks track first approval in the active pass. Ordinary later edits keep them complete; an explicit [cursor reset](doc-design-modes.md#reset-the-cursor) invalidates that completion for the next pass and reopens the same tasks/issues.

## QC, operation authority and continuation

Human acceptance, technical readiness and Git integration/publication are separate gates. Human acceptance does not turn Blocked into Ready. Authorized checkpoint commits/pushes use existing repository-operation authority without another permission question. Preparation-only stops before implementation; accepted documents still need their established preparation integration gate before an implementation branch is created.

Routine maintenance, completion/evidence edits and material corrections to existing startup inputs do not automatically activate a full interactive review. Reassess affected technical readiness and route consequential decisions appropriately. A selected active interactive review does remain pending through its requested revisions. After interruption, reuse valid work and actual decisions, resume the next eligible stage, and preserve the unresolved human boundary without inventing acceptance or regenerating documents.

Feature campaigns follow the same entry, presentation and continuation rules for each necessary new delta. Their accepted incorporation, bounded implementation and final verification/publication keep their existing owners and gates. This protocol adds no approval per implementation task or repository operation. Read-only review does not authorize repairs or unrequested downstream stages.
